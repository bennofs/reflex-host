-- | Class providing common functionality for implementing reflex frameworks.
--
-- The host monad is used to setup events from external sources (such as user input) and
-- execute actions in response to events (such as performing some IO). This class contains
-- the primitives required for such a monad, so that higher-level functions can be
-- implemented generically. An implementation is the 'AppHost' monad.
--
-- Much of the functionality of this class is also provided by its superclasses.
class (ReflexHost t, MonadSample t m, MonadHold t m, MonadReflexCreateTrigger t m,
       MonadIO m, MonadIO (HostFrame t), MonadFix m, MonadFix (HostFrame t))
      => MonadAppHost t m | m -> t where
  -- | Primitive function to create events from external sources.
  --
  -- In reflex, when you create an event (using 'newEventWithTrigger' for example),
  -- you get passed an 'EventTrigger t'. This action returns a function which, given
  -- a trigger and a value for an event, can fire the event. It takes a list of triggers
  -- with values, so you can also use it to fire multiple events in parallel.
  --
  -- Note that the events fired by this function are fired asynchronously. In particular,
  -- if a lot of events are fired, then it can happen that the event queue already
  -- contains other events. In that case, those events will be fired first.
  getFireAsync :: m ([DSum (EventTrigger t) Identity] -> IO ())

  -- | Get a function to run the host monad. Useful for implementing dynamic switching.
  --
  -- Running the host monad performs 3 steps:
  --
  -- 1. First, the events and behaviors (using hold) are created. This step does not read
  --    the value of any behavior, since that breaks MonadFix in some cases.
  -- 2. After all events and behaviors have been created, the initial value of behaviors
  --    can now be read (using for example 'sample')
  -- 3. This information is then used to create an 'AppInfo' which contains all the
  --    information about the actions to perform in response to the FRP events.
  --
  -- This is why the type of the @run@ function returned by this action is
  -- @m a -> HostFrame t (HostFrame t (AppInfo t), a)@.
  -- Executing outermost @HostFrame t@ will only perform step 1. The inner layer will
  -- then perform step 2, and the returned 'AppInfo' represents step 3.
  getRunAppHost :: m (m a -> HostFrame t (HostFrame t (AppInfo t), a))

  -- | Run an action after all other actions have been run and add information about the
  -- application. After the host monad's actions have been executed, actions registered
  -- with this function will be run and the returned 'AppInfo's will be merged to get the
  -- final 'AppInfo'.
  --
  -- One use case for this function is to sample the initial values of some behaviors.
  -- This cannot be done directly in the host monad, since that would break MonadFix in
  -- some cases, since it is not lazy enough. Using this function, the sampling can
  -- instead be done after the host monad has finished, so the behavior is not forced too
  -- early.
